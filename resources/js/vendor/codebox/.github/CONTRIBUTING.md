## Sending a Pull Request
The core team is monitoring for pull requests. We will review your pull request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation.

**Before submitting a pull request**, please make sure the following is done:

1) Fork the repository and create your branch from the correct branch.

2) Run npm install in the repository root.

3) If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!

4) Ensure the test suite passes (npm run test). Tip: npm test -- --watch TestName is helpful in development.

5) Run npm test -- -u to update the jest snapshots and commit these changes as well (if there are any updates).

6) Make sure you follow our style guide (take a look at .eslint.js in the root directory).
